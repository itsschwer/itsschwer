### Hey!

I'm Schwer, a hobbyist playing around in Unity, focusing on 2D in version 2018.4!

I have an [itch.io page](https://schwer.itch.io/) where I (will) upload playable projects I'm working or have worked on.
I also have public repositories here on GitHub for those interested to reference or use for their own projects, please do check them out!

#### Want to create games with Unity?
Here's the [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4vbr3u7UKWp0iM1WIfRjCDTI03u43Zfu) that got me started. It's a tutorial series on creating a 2D Zelda-like.
While the tutorials' implementations of various features I now find a bit convoluted, it's what I've got to thank for getting me this far. 
The creator of the tutorials has a [Discord](https://discord.gg/zmykm4A), which I am a member of if you'd like to chat!
