It's Schwer, a hobbyist playing around in Unity!

I have an [itch.io page](https://schwer.itch.io/) where I (will) upload playable projects I'm working or have worked on.
I also have public repositories here on GitHub for those interested to reference or use for their own projects. Please do check them out!
